1. Identify Functional and Transitive Dependencies

Functional Dependencies:

Employee ID uniquely determines all other attributes.
Manager ID determines the position of the manager.
Department determines the manager assigned to it.
Employee names determine their unique Employee ID.
Manager ID determines the Employee ID of those managed.
Department implies positions available within it.
Position directly corresponds to the salary.


Transitive Dependencies:

Employee ID indirectly determines position through Manager ID.
Department indirectly determines positions through assigned manager.
Position directly determines the associated salary.

In the provided database table, various fields exhibit dependencies on the primary key (Employee ID), interdependencies among themselves, and transitive relationships. The Employee ID serves as the primary key, uniquely identifying each employee, making all other attributes functionally dependent on it, ensuring accurate retrieval and management of employee information. Interdependencies among fields include Manager ID determining the position held by each manager, Department determining the Manager ID associated with it, and Department determining the positions available within it. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for designing a normalized database schema that minimizes redundancy, ensures data integrity, and supports efficient querying and data manipulation operations, facilitating effective management of organizational data.
